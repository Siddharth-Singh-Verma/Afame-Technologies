# Spam SMS Detection
## Project Description
In this project, I utilized various NLP techniques to preprocess text-based SMS data, making it suitable for applying machine learning classification techniques. I employed multiple different classification algorithms to develop models capable of discerning whether an SMS is spam or not. Additionally, I utilized visual graphs to compare the accuracies of these algorithms.

##NLP techniques used:

* Regular expression for removing unwanted characters
* Lemmatization for grammar correction
* CountVectorizer for tokenization
##ML algorithms used:

* Naive Bayes classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
